      "name": "Latex Sensitivity",
      "severity": "Mild",

  "cultivationProcess": "Jackfruit trees (Artocarpus heterophyllus) are large, evergreen trees suited to tropical lowlands. They are propagated by seeds or vegetatively (grafting, budding). Trees require ample space, sunlight, and well-drained soil. They are relatively hardy and can start producing fruit for vegetable use (unripe stage) within a few years of planting, earlier than for ripe fruit production.",
  "growthDuration": "Jackfruit trees typically start bearing fruit within 3-8 years, depending on propagation method (seedlings take longer). Unripe fruits for vegetable use are harvested while still young and firm, well before they reach full maturity and ripeness.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Young jackfruit is a versatile plant-based meat alternative; choosing it can help reduce meat consumption, which often has a higher environmental footprint.",
    "Jackfruit trees are often grown in home gardens and mixed agroforestry systems, supporting local food systems and biodiversity."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Locally sourced young jackfruit, especially fresh, has a relatively low carbon footprint. Canned or processed young jackfruit, particularly if imported from distant regions, will have a higher footprint due to processing, packaging, and transportation.",

      "description": "Young, unripe jackfruit cooked until tender and easily shreddable, then simmered in barbecue sauce to create a popular and convincing vegan alternative to pulled pork. Ideal for sandwiches and tacos.",
      "ingredients": [
        "2 cans (each approx. 20 oz or 560g) young green jackfruit in brine or water, drained and rinsed",
        "1 tablespoon olive oil or neutral cooking oil",
        "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
        "2-3 cloves garlic, minced",
        "1 cup of your favorite barbecue sauce",
        "1/4 to 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water",
        "1 teaspoon smoked paprika",
        "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
        "1/4 teaspoon black pepper (or to taste)",
        "Salt to taste (be mindful if jackfruit was in brine)",
        "Burger buns, rolls, or tortillas for serving"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Prepare the jackfruit: Drain the canned jackfruit very well and rinse it under cold water. Remove any tough core sections and any visible seeds (young seeds are often soft and edible). Place the jackfruit pieces in a bowl and use two forks or your hands to shred them into a texture resembling pulled meat.",
        "Saut√© aromatics: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3-5 minutes.",
        "Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.",
        "Cook jackfruit: Add the shredded jackfruit to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing some pieces to get slightly browned and a bit crispy. This helps develop texture.",
        "Add spices: Stir in the smoked paprika and ground cumin, cooking for another minute to toast the spices.",
        "Simmer with sauce: Pour in the barbecue sauce and 1/4 cup of vegetable broth (or water). Stir everything well to ensure the jackfruit is fully coated.",
        "Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let it cook for at least 20-30 minutes. For an even more tender result, you can simmer for up to 1 hour. Stir occasionally and add more broth/water if the mixture becomes too dry.",
        "Finish and serve: Uncover the skillet and continue to cook for another 5-10 minutes, allowing any excess liquid to evaporate and the sauce to thicken and lightly caramelize on the jackfruit.",
        "Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper if needed. Be cautious with salt if your jackfruit was canned in brine.",
        "Serve the BBQ pulled jackfruit warm on burger buns, rolls, or in tacos, often accompanied by coleslaw or pickles."
