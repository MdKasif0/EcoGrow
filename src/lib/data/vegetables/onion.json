  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Can be grown from seeds, sets (small bulbs), or transplants. Plant in early spring for summer harvest or late summer/fall for overwintering in mild climates.\n2. Soil: Prefer well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter with a pH of 6.0-7.0.\n3. Spacing: Space sets 4-6 inches apart in rows 12-18 inches apart.\n4. Watering: Requires consistent moisture, especially during bulb formation. Avoid waterlogging.\n5. Weeding: Keep the area weed-free, as onions don't compete well with weeds.\n6. Harvesting: Harvest when tops begin to yellow and fall over. Pull bulbs and cure them in a warm, dry, airy place for 1-2 weeks before storing.",
  "growthDuration": "90-120 days from sets, longer from seed.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store whole, unpeeled onions in a cool, dark, dry place with good air circulation.",
