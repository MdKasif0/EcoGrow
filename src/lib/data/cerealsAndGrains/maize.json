  "description": "Maize, also known as corn, is a tall annual cereal grass that yields large grains, or kernels, set in rows on a cob. It is one of the most widely cultivated cereal crops in the world, used for human consumption, animal feed, and various industrial products.",

  "healthBenefits": [
    "Good source of fiber, aiding digestion and promoting gut health.",
    "Contains antioxidants like lutein and zeaxanthin, beneficial for eye health.",

  "potentialAllergies": [
    {
      "name": "Corn Allergy",
      "severity": "Varies (Mild to Severe)",
      "details": "An allergic reaction to proteins in corn. Symptoms can range from skin rashes and digestive issues to anaphylaxis in rare cases. Corn derivatives are common in processed foods, which can make avoidance challenging for allergic individuals."
    }
  ],
  "cultivationProcess": "Maize cultivation involves preparing a well-tilled seedbed, planting seeds after the last frost, ensuring adequate nitrogen fertilization, managing weeds and pests, and harvesting when kernels are mature (dent stage for grain, milk stage for sweet corn).",
  "growthDuration": "Typically 60-100 days for sweet corn, and 90-120 days for field corn, depending on variety and climate.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Conservation tillage or no-till farming to reduce soil erosion.",
    "Cover cropping to improve soil health and reduce nutrient runoff.",
    "Integrated pest management (IPM) to minimize pesticide use.",
    "Water-efficient irrigation methods where irrigation is necessary."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "The carbon footprint of maize varies depending on farming practices, particularly nitrogen fertilizer use (which can lead to nitrous oxide emissions). Ethanol production from corn also has associated carbon costs.",
  "uses": ["culinary", "animal_feed", "industrial", "biofuel"],
  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Maize was domesticated from a wild grass called teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) in southern Mexico between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago. Early cobs were very small. Through selective breeding by indigenous peoples, maize evolved into the diverse forms known today and spread throughout the Americas. It was introduced to Europe by Columbus and subsequently spread globally.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Optimal daytime temperature 20-30°C; sensitive to frost.",
    "rainfall": "500-1000mm during the growing season, or irrigation. Requires good moisture during tasseling and silking.",
    "altitude": "Can be grown from sea level to over 3000m, but most commercial production is in lowland and mid-altitude regions."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers deep, well-drained, fertile loamy soils with good organic matter content. Optimal pH range is 5.8-7.0. Requires high nutrient availability, especially nitrogen.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Water needs are critical during germination, tasseling, silking, and early grain fill stages. While it can be rain-fed, supplemental irrigation is common in many regions to ensure optimal yields, especially in drier climates.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Planted in spring when soil temperatures reach 10-13°C. Seeds are typically sown 4-5 cm deep. Harvest for sweet corn is when kernels are in the 'milk stage'. For grain corn, harvest is done when kernels are dented and dry, typically using combine harvesters.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Common pests include corn earworm, fall armyworm, corn borers, and rootworms. Diseases include northern corn leaf blight, gray leaf spot, and Stewart's wilt. IPM strategies involve resistant hybrids, crop rotation, biological controls, and chemical control when necessary.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "For grain corn, it involves drying the kernels to 13-15% moisture content for safe storage, cleaning, and storing in bins or silos protected from pests and moisture. Sweet corn is highly perishable and needs immediate cooling and marketing or processing (canning, freezing).",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["United States (Corn Belt region)", "China", "Brazil", "Argentina", "Ukraine", "India", "Mexico", "Indonesia"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Maize is a globally significant commodity with high demand for animal feed, ethanol production, and human food products (cornmeal, cornstarch, corn syrup). Its market value is influenced by global supply, demand, weather, and energy policies."
