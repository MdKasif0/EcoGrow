  "cultivationProcess": "Gotu kola is propagated by seeds or, more commonly, by runners or division of clumps. It prefers moist, fertile soil and partial shade, though it can tolerate full sun if kept consistently moist. It can spread aggressively in ideal conditions.",
  "growthDuration": "Perennial. Can be harvested starting a few months after planting. Leaves are picked as needed.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Can be grown as a groundcover in moist, shady areas.",
    "Easy to propagate, reducing the need for commercial plants for home use.",
    "Prefers moist environments, so water conservation should be considered in drier cultivation areas."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Locally grown Gotu kola for personal use has a low carbon footprint. Commercial production for supplements and herbal products involves energy for cultivation, drying, processing, and transportation.",

It is native to the wetlands of Asia. It has a long history of use for enhancing memory, healing wounds, and promoting longevity. It is often associated with spiritual practices due to its purported cognitive benefits.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Prefers warm, humid tropical or subtropical climates, 20-35°C. Sensitive to frost.",
    "rainfall": "Requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Prefers well-distributed rainfall or regular irrigation, mimicking its native wetland habitat.",
    "altitude": "Typically grown in lowland areas, but can be found at moderate altitudes in tropical regions."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers moist, fertile, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is optimal. Can tolerate boggy conditions but also grows in well-drained moist soils.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Requires consistently moist soil. Regular watering is essential, especially in sunnier locations or drier periods. Should not be allowed to dry out completely.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Propagated by planting rooted runners or divisions. Plant in spring or during the rainy season. Leaves can be harvested continuously once the plant is established, typically by picking outer leaves. For larger harvests, the entire plant above ground can be cut and will regrow.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Generally resistant to pests. Slugs and snails can be an issue in moist conditions. Fungal leaf spots or root rot can occur if there is poor drainage or excessive humidity without good air circulation.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Fresh leaves are used for culinary purposes or juicing. For medicinal use, leaves are typically dried in shade to preserve their color and active compounds. Dried leaves are then powdered or used for extracts and teas. Store dried Gotu kola in airtight containers away from light.",
