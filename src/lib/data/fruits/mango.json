  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Mangoes thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with distinct wet and dry seasons and protection from frost.\n2. Soil: Prefer deep, well-drained, loamy soil with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.\n3. Planting: Usually propagated from grafted seedlings for fruit quality. Plant in full sun with ample space.\n4. Watering: Young trees need regular watering. Mature trees are relatively drought-tolerant but require irrigation during fruit development for best yield.\n5. Fertilizing: Apply balanced fertilizer during active growth periods, especially when young and during fruit set.\n6. Pruning: Prune to shape the tree, remove dead or diseased wood, and improve air circulation and light penetration.\n7. Pest & Disease Control: Monitor for common issues like mango hoppers, fruit flies, and anthracnose.",
  "growthDuration": "Grafted trees may start bearing fruit in 3-5 years. Fruit matures 100-150 days after flowering, depending on the variety and climate.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Choose locally grown mangoes when in season to reduce food miles.",
    "Compost mango peels and seeds, or try growing a tree from the seed (though fruit quality may vary).",
    "Freeze ripe mango chunks for later use in smoothies or desserts."

  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Varies widely based on origin and transport method (0.5-1.5 kg CO2e/kg). Air-freighted mangoes have a significantly higher footprint.",

  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Mangoes originated in the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. They were domesticated in South Asia thousands of years ago, with cultivation dating back at least 4,000 years. From there, they spread throughout Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, and were later introduced to Brazil, the West Indies, and Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish explorers.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Tropical and subtropical conditions, optimal 24-30°C. Sensitive to frost. A distinct dry period before flowering is beneficial.",
    "rainfall": "Requires moderate rainfall, 750-2500mm annually, with a dry season for fruit set. High humidity during flowering can affect pollination.",
    "altitude": "Typically grown from sea level up to 1200m, depending on the variety."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Well-drained, deep loamy or sandy loam soils rich in organic matter. Prefers a slightly acidic to neutral pH (5.5-7.5). Tolerates a range of soils but not waterlogged or very heavy clay soils.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Young trees require regular watering. Mature trees are relatively drought-tolerant but benefit from irrigation during prolonged dry spells, especially during flowering and fruit development, to ensure good yield and fruit quality.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Propagated from grafted seedlings or sometimes seeds (though fruit quality from seed can be variable). Planted at the beginning of the rainy season or with irrigation. Trees typically start bearing fruit in 3-6 years. Flowers bloom in late winter/spring, and fruits mature in 3-5 months, with harvest season in summer depending on variety and location. Harvested by hand when fruits are mature green to partially ripe.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Common pests include mango hoppers, fruit flies, mealybugs, and scale insects. Major diseases are anthracnose, powdery mildew, and malformation. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) includes resistant varieties, orchard sanitation, proper pruning, biological controls, and targeted fungicide/insecticide applications.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Mangoes are harvested mature green or with some color development. They are perishable and bruise easily. Post-harvest treatments may include hot water treatment to control anthracnose and fruit fly. Ripened at room temperature or under controlled conditions. Stored at around 10-13°C for export/transport. Careful packing is essential.",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["India (leading producer)", "China", "Thailand", "Indonesia", "Mexico", "Pakistan", "Brazil"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Mangoes are one of the most popular tropical fruits globally, often called the 'king of fruits'. They have significant economic importance for producing countries, with substantial international trade in fresh fruit and processed products (pulp, juice, dried mango). Demand is high and growing worldwide.",

        "Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a bowl. Gradually pour the remaining warm coconut milk mixture (not the reserved portion) over the hot rice, stirring gently to combine. Cover the bowl and let the rice sit for 20-30 minutes to allow it to absorb the coconut milk and become creamy.",
