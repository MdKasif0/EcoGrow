## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:9002 in your browser

## Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** This project uses a specific Node.js version. Please ensure you are using a version compatible with the one specified in the `.nvmrc` file (e.g., by using NVM: `nvm use`).

## Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set up for full functionality, especially for AI features and Firebase integration (if applicable).

1.  Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Edit the newly created `.env` file and fill in the required API keys and configuration values:
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google AI (Gemini) API key for server-side AI features.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`: Your Firebase project's API Key.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`: Your Firebase project's Auth Domain.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Firebase project's Project ID.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`: Your Firebase project's Storage Bucket.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`: Your Firebase project's Messaging Sender ID.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`: Your Firebase project's App ID.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your VAPID public key for enabling push notifications.

**Note on API Keys:**
Keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control. The `.gitignore` file is already configured to ignore `.env*` files.
Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the client-side. For sensitive keys like `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (used for server-side operations), ensure they are not prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for automated tests.

*   To run all tests once:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
*   To run tests in interactive watch mode:
    ```bash
    npm run test:watch
    ```
