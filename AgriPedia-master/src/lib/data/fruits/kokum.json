  "description": "A fruit-bearing tree in the mangosteen family (Clusiaceae), native to the Western Ghats of India. The fruit is small, round, and turns from red to dark purple when ripe. The outer cover (rind) is dried and used as a distinctive souring agent in cuisines, while the seeds yield an edible fat known as kokum butter.",

  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Climate: Tropical, prefers warm and humid conditions with well-distributed rainfall.\n2. Soil: Grows well in lateritic, alluvial, or sandy loam soils with good drainage and acidic pH.\n3. Propagation: Seeds (sown fresh) or grafting for select varieties.\n4. Planting: Plant in partial shade when young, transitioning to full sun as it matures. Spacing depends on whether grown as a tree or managed orchard.\n5. Watering: Regular watering for young plants. Mature trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but benefit from irrigation during prolonged dry spells for better yield.\n6. Fertilizing: Responds well to organic manure. Generally low input requirement.\n7. Harvesting: Fruits are harvested when they turn deep purple. The rind is then typically separated from the pulp/seeds and dried for culinary use.",
  "growthDuration": "Seedling trees typically start bearing fruit in 7-10 years, while grafted plants may begin in 4-5 years. Fruits ripen in the summer months (April-May, sometimes extending to June).",

  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Kokum (Garcinia indica) is native to the Western Ghats of India, a global biodiversity hotspot. It has been an integral part of the traditional food and medicine systems in this region for centuries, particularly in the coastal areas of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala. While it hasn't undergone the extensive formal domestication process seen in major global fruit crops, local communities have long utilized and managed wild or semi-wild stands. Selection by these communities has likely favored trees with better fruit yield and quality. Its cultivation largely remains confined to its native areas and similar tropical climates, making it a significant element of local ethnobotany and culinary heritage rather than a widely traded international commodity in its fresh form.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Kokum is a tropical tree that thrives in warm and humid conditions. The optimal temperature range for its growth is generally between 20째C and 30째C (68째F to 86째F). It is sensitive to frost, especially when young. Mature trees can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures but not prolonged cold spells.",
    "rainfall": "Requires a well-distributed annual rainfall, typically between 1500mm and 3000mm. It can withstand heavy monsoon rainfall provided the soil has good drainage. A period of relative dryness can be beneficial before flowering.",
    "altitude": "Grows well in coastal regions and at lower elevations, typically from sea level up to about 800 meters (approx. 2600 feet) in the Western Ghats and similar environments."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers well-drained, acidic, lateritic soils, which are common in its native Western Ghats habitat. It can also grow in sandy loams or alluvial soils, provided they are rich in organic matter and have good drainage. The tree does not tolerate waterlogged conditions or highly alkaline soils.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Young kokum plants require regular watering for proper establishment, especially during dry periods. Mature trees are somewhat drought-tolerant but benefit from supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry spells, particularly during the flowering and fruit development stages, to ensure good yields and fruit quality. However, over-irrigation should be avoided.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Kokum is commonly propagated from seeds, which should be sown fresh as they have a short viability period. For cultivating specific types or ensuring earlier bearing, vegetative propagation methods like softwood grafting or air layering are sometimes used. Planting is usually done at the beginning of the rainy season. Seedling trees may take about 7-10 years to start bearing fruit, while grafted plants can begin fruiting in 4-5 years. The trees typically flower from November to February. Fruits ripen in the summer months, from April to May, sometimes extending into June. Fruits are harvested when they turn a deep purple color and are slightly soft to the touch. They are generally hand-picked from the tree or collected after they have naturally fallen (though this can lead to fruit damage). After harvest, the rind is separated from the pulp and seeds and is then sun-dried or dried using mechanical driers to produce the culinary 'amsol' or kokum.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Kokum trees are generally known for their hardiness and are not severely affected by many pests or diseases, especially when grown in their native environment under traditional, low-input systems. Occasionally, minor issues with scale insects or mealybugs might occur. Fruit rot can be a problem during periods of very high humidity or if fruits are damaged and left on the ground. Good orchard sanitation and ensuring proper air circulation through pruning are generally sufficient to manage these issues. Due to its resilience, it typically requires minimal or no chemical pest control.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "The fresh kokum fruit is perishable and has a relatively short shelf life. For culinary use, the primary product is the dried rind (often called 'amsol' or simply 'kokum'). To prepare this, the ripe fruits are cut open, the pulp and seeds are scooped out (seeds are reserved for kokum butter extraction), and the rinds are then thoroughly dried, either by sun-drying (which can take several days) or by using mechanical driers. Properly dried kokum rinds become dark purple-black, leathery, and can be stored for several months to a year in airtight containers, away from moisture. Kokum butter is extracted from the seeds by crushing and boiling them to separate the fat.",
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Dried kokum rind is a staple and highly valued souring agent in the cuisines of western and southern India, particularly in Goan, Maharashtrian, Konkan, and some Gujarati and Karnataka dishes. There is a strong and consistent local and regional demand for dried kokum. Kokum sherbet concentrate and ready-to-drink kokum beverages also have a popular seasonal market. Kokum butter is gaining increasing recognition and demand in the natural cosmetics and food industries as a specialty fat and a sustainable alternative to other emollients like cocoa butter. While fresh kokum fruit has limited trade outside its growing regions due to its perishability, the demand for its value-added products (dried rind, butter, juice concentrate) is growing, including some niche international interest driven by its unique flavor profile, culinary uses, and health benefits, particularly the antioxidant properties of garcinol.",
