  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) is native to the Western Ghats of southwestern India, where it has been cultivated for thousands of years (estimated 3000-6000 years). It is considered an ancient crop in India. From its origin, jackfruit cultivation spread to other parts of South and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, as well as to East Africa. It was later introduced to tropical regions of the Americas (such as Brazil and the Caribbean) and Australia. The tree is valued for its large, nutritious fruit, which can be consumed at different stages of maturity, and for its versatile timber. Different varieties have been selected over time for fruit size, flesh characteristics, and sweetness.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Thrives in tropical and near-tropical, humid climates. The optimal temperature range for growth is between 20-35°C (68-95°F). Jackfruit trees are highly sensitive to frost; young trees can be killed by temperatures below 0°C (32°F), and mature trees may tolerate very brief, light frost but will suffer damage. Consistent warmth is needed for good fruit development.",
    "rainfall": "Prefers a well-distributed annual rainfall ranging from 1000mm to 2500mm. While established trees can tolerate some periods of drought, regular moisture is essential for optimal fruit production and quality. It does not tolerate prolonged waterlogging.",
    "altitude": "Typically grown in lowland tropical regions, from sea level up to about 1200 meters (approx. 4000 feet). Growth and fruiting may be reduced at higher elevations where temperatures are cooler."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Jackfruit trees prefer deep, well-drained, alluvial or loamy soils that are rich in organic matter. They can adapt to a variety of soil types, including sandy loams and lateritic soils, but good drainage is essential to prevent root rot. The ideal soil pH range is between 6.0 and 7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral). They do not perform well in compacted or waterlogged soils.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Young jackfruit trees require regular and consistent watering to ensure proper establishment and vigorous growth. Mature, fruit-bearing trees are relatively drought-tolerant once established, but they benefit significantly from supplemental irrigation during prolonged dry periods, especially during the flowering and fruit development stages. Adequate soil moisture during these critical periods is crucial for good fruit set, size, and overall yield. However, overwatering and waterlogged conditions should be avoided.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Propagation is primarily done using seeds, which should be planted fresh as they are recalcitrant and lose viability quickly. For superior cultivars and earlier bearing, vegetative propagation methods like grafting (e.g., epicotyl grafting, cleft grafting), budding, or air layering are employed. Planting is usually carried out at the beginning of the rainy season, ensuring ample space for the tree's large canopy. Seedling trees typically take 3-8 years to start bearing fruit, while grafted trees may begin producing in 2-4 years. Jackfruit trees are monoecious, meaning they have separate male and female flowers on the same tree; pollination is mainly by wind and insects. The massive fruits take 3-8 months to mature on the tree after flowering. Harvesting time depends on the intended use: young, unripe fruits for vegetable purposes are picked when they are small, green, and firm. Ripe fruits are harvested when they emit a strong, sweet aroma, the skin color changes from green to a slightly yellowish-brown or greenish-yellow, the spines on the skin flatten or yield to gentle pressure, and the fruit produces a dull, hollow sound when tapped. Fruits are typically cut from the tree with a portion of the stalk attached, as they are very heavy.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Common Pests: Jackfruit borer (Margaronia caesalis, Diaphania caesalis) larvae bore into shoots, buds, and young fruits, causing significant damage. Mealybugs and scale insects can infest young shoots and fruits. Fruit flies (Bactrocera spp.) may occasionally attack ripe fruits. Rodents, monkeys, and jackals can also damage or consume ripe fruits on the tree. Common Diseases: Rhizopus fruit rot (soft rot), caused by Rhizopus artocarpi, is a major disease affecting ripe fruits, especially if they have wounds or are overripe. Pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor) can affect branches, causing dieback. Leaf spot diseases caused by various fungi can also occur. Root rot can be an issue in poorly drained or waterlogged soils. Management Strategies: Maintaining good orchard sanitation, including the removal of fallen fruits and diseased branches, is important. Pruning to improve air circulation can help reduce fungal diseases. Protecting young trees from borers by wrapping stems or using appropriate insecticides. Bagging of young fruits can offer protection against borers and fruit flies. For Rhizopus rot, careful handling of fruits to avoid wounds and timely harvesting are crucial. Fungicidal sprays may be needed for severe leaf spot or pink disease outbreaks.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Unripe jackfruit intended for use as a vegetable can be stored at room temperature for a few days or refrigerated for a slightly longer period. Ripe jackfruit has a limited shelf life once harvested, typically lasting a few days to about a week at ambient room temperature, depending on its ripeness. Refrigeration at 10-13°C (50-55°F) can extend the shelf life of ripe fruit or cut portions. The fruit is large and very heavy, requiring careful handling to prevent damage. Cutting open a jackfruit can be challenging due to its size and the sticky latex it exudes; oiling hands and the knife is highly recommended. Once cut, the fleshy bulbs (pods) can be extracted and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several days or frozen for longer-term storage. Seeds should be removed from the pods before storage or consumption.",

  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Jackfruit is a highly valued staple food in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, consumed both in its ripe (sweet) and unripe (vegetable) forms. Its timber is also economically important in these regions. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in international demand for unripe jackfruit, particularly in Western countries, where it is used as a meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan cuisine due to its texture. Ripe jackfruit and processed products like canned jackfruit, dried jackfruit chips, and jackfruit flour also have growing niche markets globally. The market value varies significantly based on local availability, variety, whether it's sold ripe or unripe, and its intended use (fresh consumption vs. processing for meat substitute).",
