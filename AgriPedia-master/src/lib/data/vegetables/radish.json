  "cultivationProcess": "Step-by-Step Growing Guide:\n1. Planting: Cool-season crop. Sow seeds directly in early spring as soon as soil can be worked, or in late summer/early fall for a fall crop.\n2. Soil: Loose, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. pH 6.0-7.0.\n3. Spacing: Sow seeds 1/2 inch deep, 1 inch apart, in rows 12 inches apart. Thin seedlings to 2-3 inches apart for small varieties, more for larger Daikon types.\n4. Watering: Consistent moisture is crucial for rapid growth and to prevent roots from becoming woody or overly pungent.\n5. Harvesting: Harvest small round radishes when roots are about 1 inch in diameter (typically 3-5 weeks after sowing). Daikon types take longer. Pull gently from the soil.",
  "growthDuration": "3-5 weeks for small round varieties; 6-10 weeks for larger winter radishes (like Daikon).",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store radishes (greens removed) in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper for 1-2 weeks.",
    "Radish greens are edible and can be used in salads, stir-fries, or pesto.",
    "Thinly sliced radishes add a peppery crunch to salads, tacos, and sandwiches."
