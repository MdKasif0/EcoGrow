    {
      "name": "Glycoalkaloids (Solanine)",
      "severity": "Moderate",

    }
  ],
  "cultivationProcess": "Potatoes are grown from 'seed potatoes' (small tubers or pieces of tubers with 'eyes'). They prefer well-drained, loose, slightly acidic soil (pH 5.0-6.0) and full sun. Plants are 'hilled up' by mounding soil around the stems as they grow; this encourages more tubers to form and protects them from sunlight.",
  "growthDuration": "70-120 days from planting to harvest, depending on the variety (early, mid-season, late) and growing conditions.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Store potatoes in a cool, dark, dry, and well-ventilated place. Avoid refrigeration, as it can cause starch to convert to sugar, affecting taste and texture when cooked.",
    "Keep potatoes away from onions, as the gases they emit can cause each other to spoil faster.",
    "Leave the skin on when cooking (after scrubbing well) for extra fiber and nutrients."
  ],
  "carbonFootprintInfo": "Relatively low footprint for unprocessed potatoes (0.2-0.5 kg CO2e/kg), especially if grown with minimal inputs. Processing (e.g., into fries or chips) and long-distance refrigerated transport significantly increase this.",
