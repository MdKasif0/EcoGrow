  "cultivationProcess": "Chamomile is grown from seeds. German chamomile is an annual that self-seeds readily. Roman chamomile is a perennial often used as a ground cover. Both prefer well-drained soil and full sun to light shade. Flowers are harvested when fully open.",

  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Attracts beneficial insects like hoverflies and predatory wasps.",
    "Can be grown with minimal inputs in suitable climates.",
    "Self-seeding varieties (like German chamomile) can be easy to maintain."

  "originAndDomesticationHistory": "Chamomile has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) is native to Europe and temperate Asia. Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) is native to Western Europe and North Africa. Both have long been valued for their gentle therapeutic properties.",
  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Prefers cool to warm temperate climates. Optimal growing temperatures are 15-25Â°C. German chamomile is more adaptable than Roman chamomile.",
    "rainfall": "Requires moderate and consistent moisture, especially during germination and early growth. Around 400-800mm equivalent. Good drainage is important.",
    "altitude": "Adaptable to various altitudes, typically grown in lowland and foothill regions."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers well-drained, sandy loam or loamy soils. German chamomile tolerates poorer soils better than Roman chamomile. Slightly acidic to neutral pH (5.5-7.5) is suitable.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Requires regular watering to keep the soil evenly moist, especially during dry periods. Avoid waterlogging. Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are good options.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "German chamomile is usually direct-seeded in spring after the last frost or in late summer/early fall for overwintering in mild climates. Roman chamomile can be started from seeds or division. Flowers are harvested when fully open, typically by hand-picking or using chamomile rakes. Multiple harvests are possible throughout the flowering season.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Generally quite hardy. Aphids and thrips can occasionally be pests. Damping-off can affect seedlings in overly wet conditions. Powdery mildew may occur in humid weather with poor air circulation. Good field hygiene and proper spacing are important.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Fresh chamomile flowers can be used immediately for tea. For drying, flowers are spread in a thin layer in a warm, dark, airy place, or a dehydrator on low heat can be used. Dried flowers should be stored in an airtight container away from light to preserve their aroma and medicinal properties.",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["Egypt (major exporter)", "Argentina", "Hungary", "Poland", "Germany", "Czech Republic", "Mexico", "United States"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Chamomile is one of the most popular herbal teas worldwide, with high and stable demand. It's also used extensively in cosmetics, personal care products, and aromatherapy for its essential oil (containing chamazulene and bisabolol). The market for organic and sustainably sourced chamomile is growing."
