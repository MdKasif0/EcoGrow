  "cultivationProcess": "Arjuna trees are typically grown from seeds. They prefer moist, fertile soil and are often found along riverbanks. The tree is large and requires ample space.",
  "growthDuration": "Slow to medium-growing perennial tree. Bark is usually harvested from mature trees (15-20 years old) to ensure sustainability and potency.",
  "sustainabilityTips": [
    "Sustainable harvesting practices for bark are crucial to prevent damage to trees and ensure long-term availability.",
    "Often grows naturally along water bodies, contributing to riparian ecosystems.",

  "climaticRequirements": {
    "temperature": "Subtropical to tropical tree. Prefers temperatures between 20-35Â°C. Can tolerate a wider range once established but sensitive to severe frost when young.",
    "rainfall": "Requires moderate to high rainfall, typically 750-2000mm annually. Often found in areas with access to groundwater near rivers.",
    "altitude": "Can be grown from sea level up to 1500m."
  },
  "soilPreferences": "Prefers deep, fertile, alluvial loamy or clayey-loam soils with good moisture retention. Often found along riverbanks and watercourses. Slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.5) is suitable.",
  "irrigationAndWaterNeeds": "Young trees require regular watering until established. Mature trees are relatively drought-tolerant but thrive with access to soil moisture, especially during dry seasons. Irrigation may be needed in drier cultivation areas.",
  "plantingAndHarvestCycles": "Propagated from seeds, which are sown in nurseries and transplanted. Bark is harvested from mature trees, typically in the dry season (spring) when it is easier to peel and has higher alkaloid content. Only portions of bark are removed from a tree at a time to allow for regeneration and prevent killing the tree. Harvesting is often done on a rotational basis.",
  "pestAndDiseaseManagement": "Generally a hardy tree. May be susceptible to some wood borers or defoliating insects. Fungal diseases are rare in well-managed trees with good air circulation. Sustainable harvesting is more of a concern than pests/diseases for its medicinal use.",
  "postHarvestHandling": "Harvested bark is cleaned, cut into pieces, and dried in shade to preserve its medicinal properties. Dried bark is then stored in cool, dry places and can be powdered or used to make decoctions and extracts.",
  "majorProducingCountriesOrRegions": ["India (throughout various states)", "Sri Lanka", "Bangladesh", "Nepal"],
  "marketValueAndGlobalDemand": "Arjuna bark is a significant commodity in the Ayurvedic and herbal medicine market, particularly in India. Demand is increasing globally as interest in traditional remedies for heart health grows. Sustainable sourcing and quality control are important aspects of its market."
